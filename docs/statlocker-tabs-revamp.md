# Wall Ball

Let's hard-gate Wall Ball progression behind full completion **and** a **coach sign-off**. Here's the drop-in spec to layer on top of the Skills tab we just designed.

# **üîí Wall Ball Progression ‚Äî Coach-Verified Unlocks**

## **1\) Core Rule (Authoritative)**

A player **cannot** unlock the next Wall Ball drill (or advance tiers) until:

1. They **complete all required reps** for the current drill at full speed with no drops (per drill criteria), and

2. A **verified coach** reviews the attempt and **approves** it.

If either fails ‚Üí drill stays locked; athlete receives feedback \+ can resubmit.

---

## **2\) Athlete UX Flow**

**A. Start Drill (Locked state visible for next drills)**

* Drill Card shows lock üîí and "Coach sign-off required to unlock."

* CTA: **Start Drill** (current drill) ‚Üí Log Reps.

**B. Log Reps ‚Üí Complete Attempt**

* Rep logger enforces target reps (e.g., "50 clean reps").

* Anti-spam guardrails:

  * Minimum elapsed time gate (e.g., ‚â• 90 sec for 50 reps).

  * Pace sanity check (no impossible reps/sec spikes).

  * Optional "No drops" self-attest checkbox (if no AI/video).

* Optional: **Attach proof** (15‚Äì30s clip or selfie video) for remote coaches.

---

## **3\) Coach UX Flow**

**Entry points**

* **Skills \> Approvals** queue (coach app)

* Messaging inbox card: "3 drills awaiting approval"

* Player profile \> Skills tab \> Pending items

**Approval Screen (per submission)**

* Header: Player, Drill, Tier, Position

* Evidence: Rep log summary (reps, duration, pace), video thumbnail (if any)

* **Criteria checklist** (coach must tick):

  * ‚úÖ Required reps reached

  * ‚úÖ Speed standard met (full speed)

  * ‚úÖ No drops / clean execution

* Comment box (required on reject, optional on approve)

* Actions: **Approve** / **Reject**

**Bulk workflow**

* Multi-select ‚Üí Approve/Reject with identical comment (optional).

---

## **4\) States & UI**

* **Locked (up next):** Grey card, lock icon, "Complete previous drill \+ coach sign-off."

* **In Progress:** Progress ring, "32/50 reps logged."

* **Pending Review:** Yellow badge "Pending Coach," disable log edits, show submitted timestamp.

* **Approved:** Green badge, confetti on unlock; next drill activates.

* **Rejected:** Red badge, reason pill (tap to view full note), **Try Again** CTA.

**Microcopy**

* Pending: "Good work. We've sent this to your coach for a quick review."

* Rejected: "Almost there. Coach feedback: keep stick head out in front; reduce cradles."

* Approved: "Signed off. Unlocking your next challenge."

---

## **5\) Notifications**

**Athlete**

* Submitted ‚Üí "Drill sent to Coach."

* Approved ‚Üí "Coach signed off. Next drill unlocked."

* Rejected ‚Üí "Coach left feedback. Try again."

**Coach**

* New submission ‚Üí "Review requested: \[Player\] ‚Ä¢ \[Drill\]"

* Daily digest (if pending \> N)

---

## **6\) Data Model (Firestore-friendly)**

`users/{athleteId}/skills_progress/{programId}   // programId = "wallball_lacrosse"`  
`{`  
  `tier: "Silver",`  
  `currentDrillId: "WB_SLV_14",`  
  `completedDrillIds: ["WB_BRZ_01", "..."],`  
  `pendingSubmissions: [submissionId],`  
  `lastUpdatedAt: TS`  
`}`

`skills_submissions/{submissionId}`  
`{`  
  `athleteId,`  
  `programId: "wallball_lacrosse",`  
  `drillId: "WB_SLV_14",`  
  `tier: "Silver",`  
  `repsLogged: 50,`  
  `durationSec: 120,`  
  `dropsReported: 0,`  
  `evidence: { videoUrl?, frames? },   // optional`  
  `status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected",`  
  `coachReview: {`  
    `coachId?,`  
    `checked: { reps: bool, speed: bool, clean: bool },`  
    `comment?,`  
    `decidedAt?: TS`  
  `},`  
  `createdAt: TS`  
`}`

**Unlock logic (deterministic):**

* A drill **unlocks** only if:

  * previous drill has a **submission.status == 'approved'** (or is the first drill in tier), and

  * any program-level prerequisites are satisfied (e.g., "Complete all Bronze to unlock Silver").

---

## **7\) Security Rules (essentials)**

* Only the **athlete** can create a submission for their userId.

* Only **verified coaches** linked to athlete's team/roster can write `coachReview` and change `status` from `pending`.

* Athletes cannot edit a submission once created (only cancel if `pending` and no review yet).

* Server-side rules (or callable function) recompute **unlock state** ‚Äî never trust client toggles.

---

## **8\) Anti-Cheat & Integrity**

* **Pace sanity** check: average reps/sec within human bounds (configurable per drill).

* **Minimum session time** threshold tied to rep targets.

* **Streak randomness**: If exact same timestamps appear across attempts, flag for manual review.

* **Optional vision add-on**: spot check via short video; random coach audits.

---

## **9\) Edge Cases**

* **Multiple coaches:** Athlete selects reviewer; any coach on roster can approve.

* **Coach offline:** Submission stays pending; gentle reminders (24h).

* **Wrong team coach:** Block approval (not on athlete's roster).

* **Resubmission:** Fresh submissionId; keep audit trail.

* **Tier completion:** All drills approved ‚Üí **Tier Up** ceremony; next tier's first drill unlocks.

---

## **10\) Coach Feedback Loop**

* Coach rejection **requires comment**; suggested quick-replies:

  * "Form breaks at rep ~30; reduce cradles."

  * "Off-hand too slow; repeat Bronze 7 tomorrow."

  * "Great pace; ready for next."

* Feedback appears in athlete's **Milestones & Feedback** section and in drill history.

---

## **11\) Analytics**

* `skills_submission_created` { drillId, tier }

* `skills_submission_approved` { coachId }

* `skills_submission_rejected` { reasonTag }

* `skills_unlock_next_drill` { nextDrillId }

* `skills_tier_up` { from, to }

---

## **12\) UI Components to Add**

* `<ApprovalBadge status="pending|approved|rejected" />`

* `<CoachChecklist />` (reps/speed/clean toggles)

* `<EvidenceBlock />` (video thumbnail, duration)

* `<GateBanner variant="locked|pending|rejected" />`

* `<UnlockCelebration />` (confetti \+ haptic)

---

## **13\) MVP Cut (shippable now)**

* Manual rep logging \+ submit for review

* Coach approvals with checklist & comment

* Locked/Unlocked UI \+ Pending state

* Notifications (local first, push next)

* Analytics \+ audit trail

## **üóÑ Firestore Data Model (flat, scalable)**

`teams/{teamId}`  
  `channels/{channelId}`  
    `meta: { name, type: 'announcements|chat', createdBy, createdAt }`  
    `members/{userId}: { role: 'coach|athlete', joinedAt, isMuted }`  
    `messages/{messageId}:`  
      `{`  
        `type: 'text|stat|drill|badge|announcement|poll|file',`  
        `text?, attachments?, statRef?, drillRef?, goalRef?, badgeRef?,`  
        `authorId, createdAt, editedAt?,`  
        `reactions: { 'üëç': ['u1','u2'], 'üî•': ['u3'] },`  
        `replyToId?, threadCount?`  
      `}`  
    `readReceipts/{userId}: { lastReadAt }`

`users/{userId}`  
  `dms/{dmId}`  
    `meta: { name?, isGroup, members[], createdAt }`  
    `messages/{messageId} { ...as above }`  
  `settings:`  
    `notifications: { mutedChannels: [channelId], mentionsOnly: boolean }`

**Indexes**

* `messages.createdAt` (per channel/dm)

* `messages.type` \+ `createdAt` (for quick filtering)

* `readReceipts.lastReadAt` composite for unread counts

---

## **üßØ Security Rules (essentials)**

* Only channel members can read/write its messages

* Only **coach** can write to `type='announcement'` and modify `channels.meta`

* Users can only write their own `readReceipts`

* Attachment uploads scoped to team paths; validate mime/size server-side (or in app with preflight)

---

## **‚ö° Performance**

* Use Firestore **cursors** for infinite scroll (page by createdAt desc)

* **Local cache** (persisted) \+ optimistic updates for reactions

* **Batch writes** when adding reactions / read receipts

* **Thumbnailing** for media (Storage resize functions or client-side precompress)

---

## **üìä Analytics (name them once, thank yourself forever)**

* `chat_opened` { channelId }

* `message_sent` { type, channelId }

* `message_reacted` { emoji }

* `announcement_ack` { channelId }

* `poll_voted` { pollId, option }

* `drill_assigned` / `drill_completed_from_chat`

* `badge_shared_from_chat`

---
